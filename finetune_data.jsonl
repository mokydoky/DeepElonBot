What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!\"\n\nAlthough impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.\n\n\"No, no, just name anyone else,\" Dave says.\n\n\"President Obama,\" his boss quickly retorts.\n\n\"Yup,\" Dave says, \"Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,\" and off they go. \n\nAt the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, \"Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.\"\n\nWell, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.\nAfter they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.\n\n\"Pope Francis,\" his boss replies.\n\n\"Sure!\" says Dave. \"I've known the Pope for years.\" So off they fly to Rome.\n\nDave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, \"This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope.\"\nHe disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.\n\nSure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.\n\nMaking his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, \"What happened?\"\n\nHis boss looks up and says, \"It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'"}

{"Prompt":"8 years ago today, I shared the worst joke I ever created. I reposted it 4 years ago. Here it is again for those that missed it.","Completion":"There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted.  \n  \nAbout 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.  \n  \nThe dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.  \n  \nThe grim reaper swears. \"Oh no! This always happens with identical twins\".  \n  \n\"What do you mean?\" asks the dentist.  \n  \n\"Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now.\"  \n  \nThe dentist is noticeably upset. He says \"Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life.\"  \n  \nThe grim reaper asks \"What do you have in mind?\"  \n  \nThe dentist thinks. \"How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free.\"  \n  \nThe grim reaper laughs. \"I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose?\"  \n  \nThe dentist smiles. \"I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide.\"  \n  \n\"Very well\" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.  \n  \nOnce there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. \"You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance.\"  \n  \nThe dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles.  \n  \nIt's unbelievable.  \n  \nThe shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.  \n  \nThe winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. \"You win, human. This time. Your brother will live.\" He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. \"Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died.\"  \n  \nThe dentist smiles on the phone and says. \"That's interesting, bro. Today you might say that I also had a brush with death.\""}

{"Prompt":"Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.","Completion":"His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.\n\nSam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.\n\nAnd on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... \n\nAnd the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note.  People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  Words cannot do justice to the experience.  The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.\n\nAnd on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday.  All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note.  From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.\n\nSuddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted!  The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  Soon the entire monastery was aflame.  By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.\n\nThe townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.\n\nThe mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  \"What happened?\" he asked, exasperated.\n\nThe old monk shook his head sadly. \"Isn't it obvious?\" he said. \"Sam sung Note 7.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n- EDIT - Wow, I came back and this really blew up!  Thanks so much for the kind comments, and upvotes, and gold.  I'm so glad I could give so many people a chuckle today!  "}
